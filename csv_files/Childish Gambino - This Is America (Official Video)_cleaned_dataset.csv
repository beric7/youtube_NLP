"I am Brazilian! A week ago, a 14 year old black boy named Jo√£o Pedro was killed by ""policemen"" in Rio de Janeiro, inside his own house, playing with his cousins! NO REASON! Soon after, a 19-year-old black man named Rodrigo was also killed in an action to distribute food baskets, also in Rio and WITHOUT REASON! Another case (happened if I wasn't wrong the day before yesterday, I'm not sure) of a delivery man named Matheus, was shot in the head because, according to the ""police"", he looked like a drug dealer! As if it wasn't bad, another delivery man (I can't say his name) was also killed in a stop order by ""policemen"" in a slum! (Both cases also in Rio de Janeiro) These two were not black, but their lives are also important! Just look at the ""reason"" for the deaths! Coincidence? Some ""policemen"" do not fulfill the real objective of the Police, which is to protect good citizens and go against those who really do bad things for society!

Dance distracted from the riots and violence, we look to media to be entertained and dont focus on tragedy.

There was also a white horse going by in the backround, In some cultures, white horses¬†stand for the balance of wisdom and power.

Also, I would have said that the use of the smiling and happy dancers was either more about (or in conjunction with the other messages) how we are happy to celebrate black culture -- their dance crazes, funny memes and entertainment -- except the moment it comes down to recognizing other parts of black culture, like rampant gun violence, racism and terror. ...then we don't care about it anymore.

I know just how much of a priveledge growing up as a white man has been. But that is it - a priveledge. As long as there are people who can't feel safe in their own homes like Brianna Taylor, or on the streets like George Floyd, no one has a right to safety. It can be taken away in an instant. I don't know about you, but that is not a world I want to live in. 

Just because something has good qualities doesn't mean that you can't try to improve. Sure, a kid could drop out of school in 5th grade and be able to live in the world, but that doesn't mean they should. There will always be inequality, and people will always fight back. We have more tools than could have been imagined during the Civil Rights movement, young people's voices are being lifted like never before. Now is the time to act.

Chicago, NYC, Charlotte, NC, and most of the country. Do you really think that discrimination is higher now than it was in the 1950's south, or the north for that matter? This is 2020. Have you been denied entrance to college? Are you resigned to ""colored"" and ""white"" drinking fountains? Do you have to ride on the back of the bus? Well, guess what, I was around when that was happening. And while I did not live in the South at the time, as a child of 12, I knew this was wrong, via the television footage I viewed from the violence that was coming from that era. Is there a Governor standing in front of any school in this nation that is deaning a black child from entering a school?(Google Governer George Wallace of Alabama).  It seems you know nothing of real discrimination and want to react to a popular meme that every white cop wants to harm a black offender. Is their racism in America, sure, no doubt.

Also Hispanics, and Asians - Wait, wait, no not Asians... But the rest, ya they got it rough.... Here's this guy though, saying what he wants to say because he is afforded that right, and making millions because of those before him that actually went through an era of beatings and racist chaos to give this dude the option for a better life. I have a feeling that those who caught the tail end of a baton and were sprayed down with fire hoses, and beat on by racist white cops in the streets of Chicago would tell this ""childish"" fool to stop with all of his complaining. When I hear it from people of my race, about their ""first world problems"", I automatically bring myself back to lectures from my foreign teachers who experienced WW2 with their families and lived to tell about it. Your problems are minute, and absolutely miniscule to those that people faced back then, and currently. To make it out that America is some horrible place, ask yourself why so many cross the border with major risk, pay tens of thousands to get here illegally, and then work their asses off for a second chance in life. I doubt they are worried about any small insufficiency the US might present.... They are probably more frightened of missing their chance to come here. Childish, don't spit on the graves of those before you. You made it. You did well. No one stopped you or beat you for trying. If they did, that was on you.

"People who are making memes about this should be ashamed. As you can see, Gambino is distracting you by dancing and making you not focus on whats happening in the background. The pose he made when he shot the man was from Jim Crow, the man who was shot was represented as a man named Calvin guitarist named Calvin. Also, when he says ""This a celly, thats a tool!"" Hes telling how we're just watching chaos and recording it, like it's just normal. And I believe the two chickens( one brown, one white) represent a black peson and a white person, but not entirely what it means. A few seconds in, when the man is shot, the gun is handled with care, while the man is just dragged away. Oh, and the weird smirking-face Gambino makes at the camera? Isn't being goofy. Its a nod at racism from the minstrel show era, where the cartoonish way black people used to be portrayed to white audiences. And when the church choir singing was shit with an assault rifle, Its a direct in-your-face reference to the 2015 Charleston, South Carolina Massacre church shooting. The man riding the horse symbolizes Death riding a pale horse. In this case, we see a dark cloaked figure galloping on a white horse along with a police escort. And that 17 seconds of silence was represents the 17 people who lost their lives in the Parkland, Florida school shooting. In February, groups around the country honored the lives of those lost by tsking a moment of silence for 17 seconds.

"0:22 shows a barefoot man, which represents the people on the streets that need money.
0:50 the gun pops out of nowhere, which represents how easily people can get a gun, using it irresponsibly and brutally. It also represents the brutality we put on the homeless.
0:54 giving the gun to the kid, which represents young people getting a hold up dangerous things.
1:10 is society and memes, basically showing no affection.
1:41 Charleston Massacre
2:00 the police cars are empty because it shows that police only focus on the minor things and don't want to investigate society itself.
2:44 to 3:00 is the silence of kids ans teens hiding during a school lockdown/shooting.
3:50 to 4:05 shows people getting chased to get killed or mugged.




This is America, welcome to the mess and brutality.","I have a few things to add

0:54 I guess this could be about how easy it is for kids to get guns (like you said) but I disagree because it's such a formal exchange. This point could have been made just by having the kids all have guns. I think it's actually about how guns are treated so carefully and respectfully, contrasting with the horrible treatment against the people who are being killed

2:25 Celly (cell phone) is a tool (gun) in the police's eyes, so it is an excuse to kill unarmed black men. You can also see kids in the background holding up their cell phones

2:34 An empty parked cop car, and a horse running past. Maybe saying that police are less 'modern' and effective than horses or something along those lines

3:40 It's hard to hear but the singer is saying how people treat you like a piece of shit when you're black even if you have money, and that you're treated like a big dog (pun on dawg) and caged

I'd also like to add that I have no idea what you mean by the police not wanting to  ""investigate society itself"" like how are they even supposed to do that? I think the empty cars are more a reference to police not doing enough to help the struggle of black people in America in particular, seeing as this song is so much about the black experience in America. Laws and law enforcement are not doing nearly enough to stop violence in and against black communities. They're technically there but they aren't doing anything.

I also disagree that 2:44 to 3:00 is the silence of kids hiding during a lockdown or shooting. To me the silence means more that a lot of people are dead, maybe alluding to the fact that so many black people die in America and if you live in a black community you are more likely than anybody else to have lost somebody you care about.

My final disagreement is that 3:50 to 4:05 shows ""people getting chased to be killed or mugged"". The lyrics in this section are about how white people and cops treat black people like dogs, to be killed/kenneled. When/if the people chasing Glover catch him they aren't going to mug him, they're going to kill him or lock him up because they're white police. In the rest of the video when he wasn't being chased but he was still living in a dangerous place, Glover was dancing and everybody was singing in harmony even though there was a lot of violence. There is a clear contrast at the end where there is absolutely no sense of unity between Glover and the people who are chasing him",1,3,0:22

"Sharing is caring. Dear Friend, ARE YOU SAVED?
IF YOU DIED TONIGHT WILL YOU GO TO HEAVEN OR HELL?
The Bible says: ""God is holy and heaven is holy which means perfect. God can never let anybody or anything imperfect or sinful enter heaven""ù.
Have you ever lied once? Stolen once? Hated once? The answer is yes. This makes you a liar, a thief and a murderer according to God. So if you were to die this night you will go to hell because you have sinned and the punishment of sin is death.
    The excellent news is that GOD wants you in heaven with Him. But as a just GOD, He has to punish your sins. He has provided a way to save you .There is someone perfect who was willing to take your punishment, mine and the one of the whole world.
 John 3:16 says: ""For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.""ù
So Christ died on the cross for our sins.
         
                        WHAT CAN YOU DO TO BE SAVED?
1-	Admit you are a sinner.
2-	Be willing to turn to Jesus as the only one who can save   you(repent).
                                    3-Believe that Jesus died for you, was buried and rose from the dead, according to the scriptures. Romans 10:9 says: ""that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.""ù
                                    4-Now through prayer, invite Jesus into your life to become your personal saviour.
                                     5- Pray this prayer of salvation :( Say it aloud)
Dear God, I come to you in the name of Jesus. I admit I am a sinner. I thank you that you loved me so much to send Your Son to die in my place. I believe in my heart that Jesus Christ died on the cross and shed His blood for my sins, was buried and rose again.
I ask you to forgive me,Father.
I now invite you Lord Jesus, to come into my heart and life as my personal Lord and Saviour. Amen.
NOW YOU ARE SAVED OR BORN AGAIN WHAT DO YOU DO AFTER?                   
1-Read your Bible everyday to get to know Christ better and all that He has in store for you ( healing, deliverance ,prosperity etc.)
2-Talk to God in prayer everyday.
3-Be baptized, worship, fellowship and serve with other Christians in a good bibelbelieving church.
4-Tell others about Jesus.
NB: Congratulations .You have just made the most important decision of your life by accepting Jesus.

You can walk around acting tough all you want. But here's the thing, if you walk around like you want people to fear you, you may get what you want.

I would say shocking really, but I am not surprised anymore in this stupid world we live in now. Read the actual facts and don't just watch bullshite 24 hour news channels. PS...

""Hands up, don't shoot"" BLM narrative. Oh wait, the forensic evidence, you know the ""science"" they're trying to get rid of now, stated otherwise. It actually showed that Michael Brown not only didn't have his hands up, he was actually inside David Wilson's squad car reaching for his duty weapon. You can't make this shit up! Well, turns out you can. What does that science mean for BLM's narrative? Absolutely nothing because there will be more police shootings to politicize in the near future and the sheep will follow the narrative which equals more power.

In terms of Blake, the guy who had an open warrant for child abuse..... it's pretty clear to me that after shooting Blake with a taser, which renders useless, and after he told the officers he has a weapon, Blake ignores all officers warnings, even as the officer is pulling on his shirt to not go towards his car...he proceeds to his car anyway, clearly reached toward the floor board, and then the officer shoots him multiple times in the back. 

Criminal history; all you social justice warriors don't understand that YES, your criminal history and the information the officers have on this guy ahead of the call, the nature of the original 911 call etc, all work toward the ""totality of the circumstances"", meaning it can lend towards the officers decision. Those things that will be presented in court that CNN and MSNBC don't tell you about, are very important.
 
This is all about supporting a false narrative that police are out to kill you even though just about 99% of all police shootings were the result of some struggle/altercation with police just prior to the officer using his/her firearm. If you don't want to be shot by the police, quit fucking fighting them and obey the orders. If you think they're being unlawful with their authority or use of force (the super rare chance that would happen), guess what, chances are they have several cameras and microphones recording the whole interaction. Meanwhile, dozens and dozens of black people are getting murdered in the streets to black on black crime. Where is the outrage? Where is the concern for human life? Why don't they talk about the disproportionate rate of black babies being aborted or born outside of wedlock? I could go on and on...oh by the way the Hennepin Co ME's summary on George Floyd's toxicology report???

"I am ready for all the hate. This is bullshit.  There are no facts on the side of those who promoted this inverted view of reality embraced by wealthy celebrities and overpaid college professors and atheletes. Here are some facts: immigrants from Ghana (like my drum teacher) & Nigeria are wealthier on average than Americans born here. If America is a white supremacy country, how is that possible? In the 19990's Black Americans were the 11th wealthiest Nation on Earth as attested to by Black American Economist Walter Williams of George Mason University. How is that possible if America is inherently a racist country? Americans elected a Black man to be President for two terms. How is that possible if America is an inherently racist country? Oprah Winfrey is a Billionaire because millions & millions of White women loved her show. How is that possible if America is an inherently racist Country? Dr. Martin Luther King Jr transformed the political culture of the entire American south by appealing to the founding principles of American society. Don't take my word for that last claim. Look up the data. Black American Economist Thomas Sowell pointed out that Blacks used to flee the South under Jim Crow, but after Dr MLK Jr & those inspired by him dismantled Jim Crow, the net migration of Blacks has been from North to South.  How is that possible if America is inherently and irredeemably racist as wealthy celebrities try to tell us. We are being played by people who are trying to create more division. Dr Martin Luther King said we can learn to live together as brothers or we will die together as fools. Don't let Billionaires like Oprah and overpaid  left wing college professors make a fool out of you. Childish Gambino is a very talented artist. However, he let himself be brainwashed by liberal orthodoxy which controls all major institutions in the US: Entertainment, Education (k-12, college, post-Graduate), Government Bureaucracy, MSM, Facebook, Twitter, etc. Do your own research like Frederick Douglass and free your mind. Frederick Douglass was a former slave who was taught by some misinformed 19th Century white abolitionists that the US constitution was a pro-slavery document. He read it for himself and realized he had been misinformed by well meaning dummies. Don't be a dummy. Get the facts.",Gtfo,2,2,I

"The (white horse) running behind him is in the book of Revelations: as the (Antichrist).
Him (running) with (all human's) in the end then everything getting dark and his eyes wide open is in the book of Jeremiah in the Kings James Bible as once all of Lords children are killed for his name sake then the raft of God will come by braking the 6 seal: the (devil's army comes to kill all humans that was never written in the book of life). 
This is when humans will realize the devil is truly real. At this point no human will hurt each other (only trying to escape the devil's army). People will then want help from a christian but (won't) find not one. The sun won't rise like now and the moon won't shed light like now so all humans will be running and trying to hide in dark times on earth. 

All because America turn its back on God's commandments.

I'm a product marketier on Amazon.we promote Amazon Sellers products. 

WHY WE DO THIS .....
Ok let me explain


Basically Amazon Sellers need to rank there's product on the  page of Amazon and also it increase there sells vilocity . So when there sells vilocity increase there BSR(best sellers rank) also increase.


So in this case seller give  product and also do some giveaways.for this porpose we need some product tester and honest reviewer .who give us an honest review of our products.


So what we are offering you? 

We will give you some  product.you have to purchase it from Amazon and when product shipment done .then you have to give  us an honest review of our products.and when review will goes live we will refund you the price of product .


we will  refund you through PayPal and you don't need to pay PayPal fee we will do it for you.
And in most cases we beared product tax. 
And we will refund product price whithin 24 to 48 hours 

Now the only question is running in your mind is that she can scam me or she is scammer . Soo don't worry .

Amazon buyers have an advantage on seller that if any one scam you . You can return product whithin  days after shipment to Amazon and get your refund.this is Amazon return policy. You can Google it for your confirmation. 


I hope now your all doubt is cleared.
And we can build long term relation . feel free to ask me anything.

The rate of White Supremacists taking over a Trump America in the guise of Cops and citizens; are on a horrific rise. A killing spree is happening right in front of us. White racists are now killing other Whites who are taking a stand with -non-Caucasians. I made 2 other comments on this video here 1 and 2 years ago. My predictions sorely have played out.,"""ã@Doris Edwards Yeah, keep calling everyone who disagrees with you racist, that will work out well. Don't tell me to educate myself when you're the one claiming that the police force is controlled by racists and white supremacists are constantly destroying African American owned businesses and homes. Antifa and BLM riots have indiscriminately massacred small black and white businesses but you won't hear about that. You won't hear about the countless cases of black on black crime, black police harassing white criminals and black police harassing black criminals. Because you eat up everything obviously biased news sources throw in your face without ever questioning its reliability.

"the meanings and hidden messages behind this video:
The opening shows a man strumming a guitar alone to choral sounds. The camera soon goes onto Donald, As you can see the pants he is wearing is assumed to be the old confederate army pants, Within the first minute Donald shoots the man, who has been tied up with a head cover. Donald hands the gun to another man, who safely wraps it in a red cloth as the obscured man is dragged away (Donald could have picked any colour for the fabric of the cloth. He chose red because it's representative of Republican-dominated states, which shows that america value guns over black lives). Before Donald shoots the man, while he is walking over to the man he dances with ""exaggerated movements and faecal expressions"", while Donald takes the gun out before he shoots he does a pose which represents ""Jim Krow"" This ""character"" was used in the late 1800's and early 1900's, when white actors preformed in blackface (0:51). ""Jim Krow""  the fictional racist character that characterized African-Americans as ""lazy, stupid, and inherently less human."" The character was created and performed by Thomas D. Rice in the early 1800s at early minstrel shows. (1:07) As you can see kids soon join in on the dancing with Donald, They were placed there to ""distract"" you from whats going on in background, (which represents on how america puts the media first to distract you from whats going on in the ""background"" like gun violence, racist hate crimes, riots, kidnappings, and e.t.c). (1:40) In another shocking turn, Donald mows down a church choir with an assault rifle. It's an image that seems to reference the killing of nine people at a predominantly African-American church by white supremacist Dylann Roof in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. Once again, the gun is whisked away with care on a red cloth. (Even after the Roof massacre, the United States failed to pass a single law restricting gun ownership.) (2:25) He raps ""This is a celly/That's a tool."" (As he raps those verses, the camera pans up to show multiple kids holding cell phones. The line could have multiple meanings. The next verse, ""On my Kodak,"" referring to the film brand, could refer to how the proliferation of cellphones allows people to capture images of police violence.
It could also be a reference to the March 18 police shooting of Stephon Clark, an unarmed black man holding a cell phone.
or it could refer to prison cells ""î the warehouse where the music video takes place somewhat resembles a prison ""î which are used as tools of oppression.) (2:34) ""Death on a white horse gallops"" You can see a man covered with a black mask riding a white horse (The image appears to be a reference to verse 6:8 in the Book of Revelation, the last book in the New Testament. In the King James translation, it goes like this: ""And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given to them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth."") (2:45 - 3:00)  The song comes to a halt, and Glover strikes up a joint to smoke. There are 17 seconds of silence, as a moment of respect for the 17 victims of the Parkland, Florida highschool shooting, (3:30) Many of the cars have the driver's door open. (It's a metaphor representative of how African-Americans are often forced to pull over and step outside of their vehicles by police officers. Black drivers are asked to pull over at higher rates than white drivers,) All of the cars are old, all the cars in the video are models from the '80s and '90s none of them are new or flashy. Not everyone can afford the new, flashy cars in most rap music videos. It may also be a commentary on the American obsession with capitalist consumption. (3:41) The ending of the video draws comparisons to ""Get Out."" The final scene of the video shows Donald running from what seems to be white riot police officers.
(Some people understood it as him running from ""The Sunken Place"" from ""Get Out,"" a metaphysical place that holds the black consciousness while a white mind takes over a black person's body. It could be read as Donald trying to escape simply being a body to be used by white people for distraction. ) Threw out this video Donald plays the role of ""America""",This is so powerful.

"Cant believe americans can their current gun laws. When 1:55 in the video isnt an exaggeration, its what happens frequently in America, its literally a representation of one of the many shooting that happen their, i cant remember the name of the shooting just because of the sheer amount of shootings that happen there. If there was a shooting like that in the UK, France, Australia, or anywhere else with strict gun laws, everyone would remember it because of how uncommon it is. There are more gun shops in america than mcdonalds, starbucks and supermarkets combined, things need to change.

Edit: i just googled it and 1:55 is a representation of the charleston church shooting, where a white man went into the charleston church to kill mass amounts of black people, if there was gun control, he would be restricted to a knife or bat, this would of resulted in maximum 1 death as once one person has been stabbed, everyone can flee for safety and a single stab wound usually isnt fatal. Wake the fuck up, scotland had a school shooting called the dunblane massacre in 1996, as a result of it, gun laws were introduced, there hasnt been a shooting in scotland since. The UK have about 36 gun deaths average a year, the US have on average about 85 a day, compare this with the fact that the UK have about 6 guns per 100 people whereas the US have about 89 guns per 100.

I am just a little confused about your stance at this point. 

The tax increase is quite literally a false negative compared to how much you pay out to insurance companies - insured healthcare has proven to be FAR more expensive. And you'd be silly to deny this, because those insurance companies are looking to make a healthy profit, whereas government sponsored healthcare is pretty much 'take care of patient > keep a bit for taxes and shit'. It hardly even needs to be proven (though it certainly has) - we all know companies wanna make money.

And it's a MASSIVE corporate lie and scam that privatized healthcare is somehow better than universal. Who do you think screams this the most? I'll give you three guesses, and there is almost no evidence to support this claim, and there never has been. In fact, it's often worse because hospital and insurance company staff tend to treat patients like customers instead of patients, which can get in the way of a lot of things. And you can't tell me you aren't aware of the many horror stories revolving around insurance companies treating their people like garbage to make more money whenever possible? That never happens in a universal situation - everyone gets what they need.

I could write a small book on all the negatives that come with privatized healthcare. When money is involved, almost nobody acts as they should. I will forever be baffled at people wanting to pay more for less by keeping privatized health over universal health.",24,276,This

"Its the wealthy people spreading Propaganda that perpetuates the Racism in America. The Purpose is Division. If one ethnicity hates another, they would never Work with them. In the Case of America, its white People hating Black people.. or really anyone non-white. These Division are seeded by putting the blame of society's problems on an ethnic minority. This way, combined with Hate, One half of the Population will be hating and blaming minorities for Society's problems, while the Minorities will be left living in fear of their lives.

With the Population blaming innocent people in fear of their lives, the Wealthy White Men who start these division are free to do as they please because anything that they do wrong will just be blamed on Minorities. 

White Supremacy is also Perpetuated as a form of Propaganda designed to make the White Male look superior to all other identities. This is for the Purpose of justifying the Wealthy White Man's Greed. If White Men are Seen as Superior, then it gives a Justification for their Atrocities, Even though it is completely false. 

The way to Combat this is to First Realize this is true. You don't have to take my word for it. Read ""A Peoples History of the United States"" written by the famous Historian Howard Zinn. 

We then have to realize, as white men (I am a White Male), that we have been complacent in the suffering of these victims of the Wealthy White Mans propaganda.

"So I'm from Sweden, I'm 50% Swedish and 50% danish. I've never been to the US so I haven't seen any of this first hand, I only read about the racism and demonstrations going on inte the US in the news. However, I know racism is a global problem. With that said when heard this song (without seeing the video) I really didn't understand the message but I was intrigued. So I watched the music video and I was in tears. This is such a masterpiece with such a strong message.  I'm not familiar with US gun laws etc so I didn't understand everything at first, and I still don't, but I understand enough. It is insane to me how people of color are being treated. I'm at loss to understand how anyone can treat a human being the way people of color are being treated. I knew about racism before BLM and before I heard this song the first time but since I'm not a person of color and nobody I know has told me about them experiencing racism so I haven't been very educated in the subject and for that I understand I'm very privileged and also very ignorant. I will never truly understand what some people go through but I will use my privileged to make a difference wherever I can.  

We are just people nothing more, nothing less. No one is worth more or less.

You see it has to stop somewhere my friend. I have never understood racism, and can't imagine even how to be racist ""Intentionally"". There is nothing (Being a whitey) that no black folk could ever say to me that I'd take as racism personally, and well I'm pretty hard to offend actually, mainly due to preference of smiling and choosing to be happy over offended.
Media is OUR enemy, not each other.
Media is funded by the exact same people who setup up the trigger situations in BLM via HopeNotHate, Antifa, through open societies (yes I prefer only to stick to the evident facts, as opposed to the many crazy conspiracies out there).
I have a dream and it goes pretty much the same as my old boy Martin Luther to be fair.
I will always offend somebody somewhere, but it's never intentional, and ill never look for hate in this life.
I have no more or less respect for any black than I do any white, and it's only EVER media who tells me otherwise, and frankly, I'm sick of it. Peace.",2,0,Great

Media sensationalism at its finest and how they got so good at delivering news while not delivering that particular news. American media is pretty much an Artform at this point that you wanna hate it but you can't brush them off and say they are not impressive. Specially now when everyone is glued either at the TV or the Internet that's just pretty much shoves news up our throats. CNN supports the Protesters while FOX focuses on the Rioters and it's weird how they both have different opinions that's portraying a different picture of America now with the same source its ridiculous. And it's not just in America, its happening everywhere around the world so the hype is justified. China has their government run media so its 100% biased towards the Government.

it's about racism in america while trump is in command

this song was written 2 years after trump entered the presidency
this song talks about racism WHILE this song was written
also... racism was lower when Obama was in presidency
maybe because he wasn't racist and trump is
maybe because he is black, and was THE most important person in the states in the current time
the clothes most of the characters wear are the slaves clothing or the stereotypical church clothes
that obviously ""hints"" to racism, and the song, to remind you is about 2018, not the 1780's

American Indians, Ameridians, or Native Americans are considered to be the original inhabitants of America and they are the first to inhabit the lands of the countries of America and Canada...In the fifteenth century AD the European colonizer seized their lands...and He worked to wipe them out in America and Canada... and The Europeans brought diseases as a biological warfare...

"THIS IS AN EVEN MORE IMPORTANT AND POWERFUL MESSAGE today after all we have had to experience lately with the videos of murders by police and armed white civilians and the taking of innocent black American lives. AMERICA IS WAKING UP to the BS that has been distracting us from the very real problems of confronting our history, systematic racism and what it means to be BLACK IN AMERICA. As an old white guy I am ashamed of what WE have allowed to continue and what WE have ignored. Power and money has perpetrated the racist culture which we are now trying to break apart. Too many of us are looking at STYLE rather than substance. As Maya Angelou said ""When we know better we do better!""ù
Thank you for this amazingly deep and impactful art. I remember being offended by Gambino and his being shirtless, having to look at a black man made me uncomfortable! THEN, then! slowly I realized THAT THIS IT THE WHOLE POINT. White America has NEVER looked at Black America in an honest, straight forward manner. Too uncomfortable. Unnecessary. Ignore.

I mean, based on what I remembered, I think it was stated that the horseman usually would ride a pale horse (and pale color is pretty close to the color white, if you compare it side by side), so yeah, I could pretty much confirm that the horseman represents... you know, the pale one.

"My Interpretation childish is showing and representing that black entertainers, politicians anyone who made it out the system, are the new Jim Crow, saying in the begin ""we just want the money""ù he's being egotistical saying ""we want to...""ù but really meaning him as in I (black entertainers, politicians) when he shoots and kills the black man he looks back at him like he's better then him, which most black entertainers think after selling themselves out to make money. Ps (Candice Owen) His dances are what The original Jim Crow was used to distracted the white masses. It also symbolizes what most white people over the age of 30 think about black culture as stupid dumb like rap song, clothes, dances. When you see the young black kids come in the frame copying Glover (aka) New Jim Crow dances after and while the violence in the background proceeds, Childish dancing is the distraction to reality. Since most black kids in America don't understand or lack the ability to understand what's happening in the America but the newest dance, they can get do and know without hesitation. Also dancing reflects All America as the chaos in the background proceeds without getting anyone's attention only until he shoot then everyone stops, getting everyone attention like the Charleston Church shooting, school shootings, and many others. It's crazy how this music video is so relevant since you see it in real time, since covid 19 with limit entertainment, unemployment, and literally the stoppage of the world, has people dealing with everyday reality and events of racism, how we treat each other. If Covid 19 wasn't a thing guarantee you George Floyd, Breanna Taylor, Ahmed Arbery, would've last about week before it faded off for by unimportant things in society. People on the so called system would still be looked at like scum, but now that a lot of people need unemployment, because of a situation that they themselves couldn't change, gives people a reality to a lot of poor people exact situation. Then as the music goes on Glover say ""dont let them catch you slipping now""ù, I interpreted as him trying to keep up with the image of not falling off as a celebrity, then in the end as he takes a break rolls a joint he realizes he's part of the problem so he escapes, running through the tunnel could represent Underground Railroad, A slave running from his plantation, with the slave hunters trying to catch him","@Jacob Holley  thats pretty cool, I liked your interpretation was a good read my dude",5,43,My

Asians get discriminated, Hispanics get discriminated. felons get discriminated. different religious groups get discriminated, fat people get discriminated, ...etc. there is discrimination no matter what color, position or race you are. we're stronger banding together, then to continue separating everyone to get a point across. it should be ""all lives matter"" or ""our lives matter"" to fight discrimination with just simply more discrimination is total bull.","Trust me when the government pays the descendant of slaves and natives Americans, and Asians their overdue reparations for Detaining, stealing and slavery that made this country what it is today then you would have a point, and everything you mentioned as discrimination was started by The White Christian Male in Power, I agree with you all lives matter but has there ever been a case in America where The Typical White Christian male has been through any ethnicity or race has gone through?

I think they would listen to the white officer's.

First, you need empathy to fully realize your opposite as a person, acknowledge them as individuals, and also their suffering. Second, you need the ability to distance yourself, set and hold your own borders so you'll be able to go home after work and not take the suffering of others with you to affect your own life & family. Now if you put too much emphasis on the former, you will almost inevitably end up with a depression or worse, which makes you unfit for the job, but if you put too much emphasis on the latter, you will grow cold, distant, sometimes close to being outright inhuman and unfit to do the job either.

Me: Ok This Is America",cringe,1,81,Song:
"Everyone wants the American dream, but at what cost.","@Austin I'm saying that the AMERICAN DREAM was MEANT for those with white ancestry. Asian families are rich because they have to work super hard to get into the position they're in. I'm assuming that their doctors and all those occupations because they work really hard to get to this country. But I'll be honest with you, generally speaking, statistically speaking, a white man can get a job easier than his counterpart of a difference race (unless they're Asian I guess? Because of the smart Asian stereotype or because they literally hold up to it because of their culture and they know that in order to be successful in this country they have to work really really hard)

however to me the American dream is very culturally white, I bet you even rich Asian people will struggle, this country was made for white people and will die for white people.

and I NEVER said that if you are white, the dream is automatically given to you. Plenty of whites will never reach that dream. What I'm saying is that the American Dream is generally only achievable for white people. I literally said it's only possible for white people, I never said it was a given.

Also LOL I'm Asian and I can't speak for every Asian, because every person/family is different, but I know what is going on. We work really hard and our parents stress and stress that if we don't work this hard, we will be in struggle like the rest of minorities. My mother told me this everyday growing up, that's why I achieve top grades in my class. That's why I pass almost every college course with over a hundred percent. That is why we have to work so hard and that is why we achieve so high.

Since childhood, us minorities are very aware of these issues. VERY AWARE. Never for a second that I believe I could ever be in the white person's shoes.

My mother would tell me all the time: ""We are Asian, we are Asian, this is what we do. You are lucky you aren't black, this country treats black people terribly. It is sad, so sad, but that's the way it is and we can't change it. Focus on your grades and you won't suffer like I did.""

That speaks volumes. Since childhood we are expected to be at the top, otherwise we will fall to bottom. And we are quite aware of racial issues. Meanwhile, most of my white friends don't even know what is going on. At least they could be aware of the ""attributes"" that comes with their color. I'm aware of my Asian privelage (we out beat the Latinas and the black) and honestly I hate it. I hate that black people are suffering beyond anything I could imagine.

however, now that you say it, I think some Asian people are kind of like the white people in this country, in that they dominate everything and are very commercialized. I guess that's why China is a superpower as well. Idk. But I would say that many of us are suffering as well, especially with the racism against the Chinese who were building the railroads.",8,70,Everyone

But thats probably because she was black tho right,"LiveStream Meme Machine the issue is that the American police has institutionalised racism.

This incident was just another one in a long line of them but people finally got fed up. Also whether he did that stuff or not (which I'm honestly not sure about) that's no excuse for a police officer to kill him, because that's clearly not why it happened.

I believe that perpetuates and amplifies the message ""Black Lives DON'T matter"".

Please answer constructively not trash it.","And I wanted to add, as an outsider it is OBVIOUS the whole level of violence  in America is escalated by the cultural tolerance to guns. If a UK person, black or white is stopped by police they KNOW they wont be shot as a fallout of what happens because UK police do NOT carry guns. It is no excuse, but every stop an American cop makes is carried out on the basis they may be shot in the next five seconds.

*Really wish it wasn't..*","@Xander my dude you did not listen to anything I said lol. I could care less about fame if quality isn't important. Bear in mind that all of the factors I stated are rated by independent sources (no bias relation to these countries) that agree with my statements.
1) When I referred to military I meant the use of guns, and the lack of gun related deaths/incidents.
2) I don't care how famous a school is if its education is low. The US is really low in terms of education quality for most developed nations. Nordic nations often rank higher then it. 
3) When I mean wealth I mean that of individual citizens. Wealth disparity is much lower in most Nordic countries as compared to the US. 
4) That doesn't mean those social programs don't exist lol. 
5) Switzerland is literally one of the countries with the most guns in the world. Most guns are allowed in Nordic countries if you have a reason to get one (I.e. hunting, sporting, or going to a shooting range).
6)Freedom of speech is allowed in literally all of the Nordic countries ahead of the US in the factors I stated

I noticed no one said anything really about the dancing but its supposed to distract you from the background and whats happening (like how music distracts you from the real world) the facial expressions are to make sure he gets your attention but there were some parts of how he rolled his body that imitates what people thought African Americans act like. (not saying they do) And in some parts you could see the man that was riding on a horse (2:36) was in multiple scenes way in the back doing something to people. (its very hard to pause and catch them since its quick which represents how fast we forget what we did to human beings). These are some things we discussed and there was a lot more (like the seventeen seconds of silence to represent the 17 deaths in the schools shooting),ice cube  ye there's a lot of messages in this song shooting.  kids in   Masks and police.

"So what has protesting accomplished?

Within 10 days of sustained protests:
Minneapolis bans use of choke holds.

Charges are upgraded against Officer Chauvin, and his accomplices are arrested and charged.

Dallas adopts a ""duty to intervene"" rule that requires officers to stop other cops who are engaging in inappropriate use of force.

New Jersey's attorney general said the state will update its use-of-force guidelines for the first time in two decades.

In Maryland, a bipartisan work group of state lawmakers announced a police reform work group.

Los Angeles City Council introduces motion to reduce LAPD's $1.8 billion operating budget.

MBTA in Boston agrees to stop using public buses to transport police officers to protests.

Police brutality captured on cameras leads to near-immediate suspensions and firings of officers in several cities (i.e., Buffalo, Ft. Lauderdale).

Monuments celebrating confederates are removed in cities in Virginia, Alabama, and other states.

Street in front of the White House is renamed ""Black Lives Matter Plaza.""ù
Military forces begin to withdraw from D.C.

Then, there's all the other stuff that's hard to measure:

The really difficult public and private conversations that are happening about race and privilege.

The realizations some white people are coming to about racism and the role of policing in this country.

The self-reflection.

The internal battles exploding within organizations over issues that have been simmering or ignored for a long time. Some organizations will end as a result, others will be forever changed or replaced with something stronger and fairer.

Globally:

 Protests against racial inequality sparked by the police killing of George Floyd are taking place all over the world.

 Rallies and memorials have been held in cities across Europe, as well as in Mexico, Canada, Brazil, Australia, and New Zealand.

 As the US contends with its second week of protests, issues of racism, police brutality, and oppression have been brought to light across the globe.

 People all over the world understand that their own fights for human rights, for equality and fairness, will become so much more difficult to win if we are going to lose America as the place where 'I have a dream' is a real and universal political program,"" Wolfgang Ischinger, a former German ambassador to the US, told the New Yorker.

 In France, protesters marched holding signs that said ""I can't breathe"" to signify both the words of Floyd, and the last words of Adama Traor√©, a 24-year-old black man who was subdued by police officers and gasped the sentence before he died outside Paris in 2016.

 Cities across Europe have come together after the death of George Floyd:

 In Amsterdam, an estimated 10,000 people filled the Dam square on Monday, holding signs and shouting popular chants like ""Black lives matter,"" and ""No justice, no peace.""

 In Germany, people gathered in multiple locations throughout Berlin to demand justice for Floyd and fight against police brutality.

 A mural dedicated to Floyd was also spray-painted on a stretch of wall in Berlin that once divided the German capital during the Cold War.

 In Ireland, protesters held a peaceful demonstration outside of Belfast City Hall, and others gathered outside of the US embassy in Dublin.

In Italy, protesters gathered and marched with signs that said ""Stop killing black people,"" ""Say his name,"" and ""We will not be silent.""

 In Spain, people gathered to march and hold up signs throughout Barcelona and Madrid.

 In Athens, Greece, protesters took to the streets to collectively hold up a sign that read ""I can't breathe.""

 In Brussels, protesters were seen sitting in a peaceful demonstration in front of an opera house in the center of the city.

In Denmark, protesters were heard chanting ""No justice, no peace!"" throughout the streets of Copenhagen, while others gathered outside the US embassy.

 In Canada, protesters were also grieving for Regis Korchinski-Paquet, a 29-year-old black woman who died on Wednesday after falling from her balcony during a police investigation at her building.

 And in New Zealand, roughly 2,000 people marched to the US embassy in Auckland, chanting and carrying signs demanding justice.

 Memorials have been built for Floyd around the world, too. In Mexico City, portraits of him were hung outside the US embassy with roses, candles, and signs.

 In Poland, candles and flowers were laid out next to photos of Floyd outside the US consulate.

 And in Syria, two artists created a mural depicting Floyd in the northwestern town of Binnish, ""on a wall destroyed by military planes.""

Before the assassination of George Floyd some of you were able to say whatever the hell you wanted and the world didn't say anything to you...

THERE HAS BEEN A SHIFT, AN AWAKENING...MANY OF YOU ARE BEING EXPOSED FOR WHO YOU REALLY ARE. #readthatagain

Don't wake up tomorrow on the wrong side of this issue. Its not to late to SAY,

""maybe I need to look at this from a different perspective.

Maybe I don't know what its like to be Black in America...

Maybe, just maybe, I have been taught wrong."" 

There is still so much work to be done. It's been a really dark, raw week. This could still end badly. But all we can do is keep doing the work.

Keep protesting.

WE ARE NOT TRYING TO START A RACE WAR; WE ARE PROTESTING TO END IT,
PEACEFULLY.

How beautiful is that?

ALL LIVES CANNOT MATTER UNTIL YOU INCLUDE BLACK LIVES.

YOU CANNOT SAY 'ALL LIVES MATTER' WHEN YOU DO NOTHING TO STOP SYSTEMIC RACISM & POLICE BRUTALITY.

YOU CANNOT SAY 'ALL LIVES MATTER' WHEN BLACK PEOPLE ARE DYING AND ALL YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT IS THE LOOTING.

YOU CANNOT SAY 'ALL LIVES MATTER' WHEN YOU ALLOW CHILDREN TO BE CAGED, VETERANS TO GO HOMELESS, AND POOR FAMILIES TO GO HUNGRY & LOSE THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE.

DO ALL LIVES MATTER? YES. BUT RIGHT NOW, ONLY BLACK LIVES ARE BEING TARGETED, JAILED, AND KILLED EN MASSE- SO THAT'S WHO WE'RE FOCUSING ON.

BLACK LIVES MATTER

"This song is titled ""This is America""ù because the very phenomenon of you listening to it and watching the video is an American phenomenon of racism and exploitation. Let me explain:

The message Glover wants to express is that African Americans are being exploited by the entertainment industry. To them, being successful in this industry allows them to escape poverty. That's why Glover is rapping ""don't catch you slipping now,""ù he's telling you to focus on his dancing and ignore what's happening in the background. He represents a person which has managed to escape the chaos of life as a black man, and now serves as a tool for the entertainment industry to distract you from the issues we face in America. In a way, his shooting of the black guitarist in the beginning is a metaphor for how he is hurting the black community. 

At the end of the video, the camera descends below the main floor, showing you the ""underlying""ù cause behind everything you've just seen: no matter how successful he is, Glover is still a victim of racism who cannot escape the confines of America's disdain for him.","IzexJorge sir,,, I've constantly done self-reflection and know I'm not always right - I literally challenge what I think everyday (a lot of people do).

"To me, this song speaks out to police brutality and African-American violence on how both sides are in the wrong. The scene where he's dancing with black children mocks the success of young black men that gained their riches through violence; it's even in the lyrics ""Contraband, contraband, contraband. I got the plug on oaxaca"". (interpret as you will). The lyrics ""police be trippin now"" entails the use of force, and how it's misused by police, abuse of authority basically. ""Be trippin"" means overreacting over small things. Basically the police don't know how to use proper force in parts of America that there is crime, which is why the use of force usually ends up in deadly force.  For a better understanding, compare the lyrics and music videos of J . Cole ""neighbors"" and 21 savage ""Dip Dip"" , see the difference. The police and rioting community are both in the wrong in my opinion. The police and rioters should just go home, and let the protesters protest peacefully.

"Some of the meanings behind the song of you didn't know are:
His pants are the same of a slave.
Violence is so common it is accepted.
""Guns in my area, I gotta carry em""ù He is describing the issue of gun violence and having to carry one for defense.
The crowds rioting and dancing on the car. Over time the situation in the video becomes worse. More people are rioting, cars are burning. All of this is in the background. He is trying to show how we have been so oblivious on how we are so focused on him dancing, we don't really see the violence in the background. He is showing how the news can be censored and covered up. Hope this helped anyone who did not know the story behind the song.

I was sometimes stupid.  Of course, I don't know how painful black people are today.  But the yellow racial discrimination I received during the coronavirus was terrible.  There was no one to speak out to stop discrimination.  But I think.  Even if I had a grudge, nothing changed.  It's the same if you look back on the past forever.  You can see how black people grudge against white people.  But not all white people.  Don't forget your positive mind, I want you to fight with all your might.

"My comment will focus on Donald Glover and the Camera, so many hidden cameras and references in the video:
Donald Glover = Jim Crow
Camera = Media controlled/filtered by Jim Crow
Another video where you have to notice the video has round corners (it's a camera; represents media showing only what's focused upfront and in 'the box' that America wants you to see. Filters you from the truth of injustice, violence and corruption.
We also see direct skits where the camera pans off of Donald Glover for a few seconds, but immediately returns back on him because the media won't admit the *FULL TRUTH* just an acknowledgment on *some events,* if that.
Donald Glover impersonating Jim Crow Puppet/Mascot to filter and distract audience from the actual problem.
Look at how cartoonish he acts by his ragdoll/cartoon posture, and face expressions on 0:40, 0:51, 0:59-1:08, 1:16, 1:24-1:29, 1:48-1:52, 2:11, 2:25, 

He's emulating what the current Jim Crow Laws are doing and is winking or bulging his eyes to show you're not supposed to be looking at entertainment over what's actually happening. The lyrics follow with his words, and notice how goofy he acts like he's their friend before he shoots his victims down. Sounds familiar of how America treats People Of Color? 
""Land of Opportunity"" ""American Dream""
As the video progresses, ""Jim Crow Puppet"" (Donald Glover) acts less silly, and becomes blatantly serious like when he gestured the 17 seconds for Parkland shooting; no wild expressions. Similar to our situation with Floyd, Taylor, Bland, Edwards, etc. This is similar to police brutality when we raise attention and police decides to become less sensitive for protestors and civilians. Dispatches of gunning protestors, vehicles running into crowds, baton beatings, etc. are all symbolized with Donald Glover being less sensitive and more serious and straightforward, not hiding guns or blending in. Just straight up gesturing the trigger like in 2:44, but in the beginning, Glover had others taking his weapons 0:55 or him acting friendly 1:48-1:55. Now, he's pulling it, holding the trigger, and smoking a cigarette like he's tired of repeating this.

"Crazy, it looks like it was made now because of the scene with the kids in masks (coronavirus), the white horse (there's viral vids of people stealing horses, but in this video it's symbolic of death), the protesting and rioting in the background overshadowed by social media dancing / glamor / beauty (to me that's pure TikTok at this point). This music video will be referenced in our history no doubt.

We know that George should be here, that cops shouldn't be falling into these repeated patterns, and that there should be a solution in the works + proper communication to show that the problem is being worked on.

When we start to see protesters & police getting violent respectively, people breaking into stores and stealing, people beating each other up that are protesting together, people running over each other because they are scared or don't agree or whatever - it all has lost its overall meaning. At this point, nobody has a valid point to prove it seems. Nobody is left with any dignity and it's like these ""sides"" fulfilled what the other side thought about them. Even the peaceful protests who are trying to make a point are overshadowed by the riots going on, and that's too bad.

In simple terms, it seems there is no right ""side"" anymore. All we know is George should be here and a solution to this repeated problem needs to be worked on.

As for the protests the media refuses to show the fact that most protest right now, even in Minneapolis are peaceful, it's when people come in from out of state and start looting (many looters being white people and undercover cops to) that the message gets lost, racism.

This song symbolizes many things about America like the fact that guns are handled more carefully than people or the fact we care so much about luxury and not enough about justice,"The video is just about meaning. It's expressing the different ways there is racism against blacks in this nation. From shooting the gun to the back of the black musician's head, in which he subsequently places the gun into a rich red cloth, but the body is dragged away, to shooting the choir and the riots starting, children, taking videos in masks to hide identity, then him dancing with the kids where he pulls out an imaginary gun and the children run away to show that people fear the blacks, signifying how the police then kill the blacks unjustly. There's you people, the whites, and then our people, the colored. Rioting like this may be consequential to businesses and everything, but how selfish are we to have so much self interest, in times like WW1, WW2, the American Revolution, Civil War where people sacrificed their lives for better ideals, to fight for something they believe in. Innocent people, pulling out guns to fight in a war against the evil racists or oppression.",1,1,This

If you've noticed the first time Childish killed the man sitting in the chair, Childish put his gun into a red cloth and the dead man was dragged away on the ground. This represents that America cares about their gun laws rather than people. 

The dancing high school students are meant to represent social media that we're all distracted and not paying attention to what's happening around them (chaos.)

The part when Childish shot up a choir was representing the church shooting of somewhat and once again, the gun was put away and wrapped in a cloth while the dead bodies where left there.

When the high school students were dancing around Childish in the end and then they ran away when he formed a gun with his hands represents the school shootings and then the long pause after that was a moment of silence.

"This isn't just America. This is everywhere. For centuries innocent black people were forced to be slaves. Even though they gained freedom in the late 18th century, they still suffer. No matter what we do, how much we protest, the world will always be unfair.

This is how our society works. There will always be people who will judge or don't care just as there will be people who fight against them. Which is why I wonder, what do we have to do for everyone to view each other as an actual person? To not say racial slurs or kill someone because they are black? It took the civil war for them to have freedom. What do we have to do for every black person to not be discriminated? This is what scares me. Do people have to die to make a point?",Exactly.

I'm not saying that we aren't united at all, we are all one, the human race, but black lives matter. We have to accept everyone to end racism, and I do. But you also have to admit that African Americans have been through awful things that we haven't so don't say you have. You're gonna tell me you hate me, and hate is the kinda thing that makes more problems. Accept the fact that you are privileged and just treat everyone around you well, but don't say that you've had to go through what they do to, blc that is just blunt and false. I'm just trying to say that even though we all deserve to be treated equally, white privilege is a thing, and blc I am white I cannot relate to the racism that African Americans have to deal with, and I won't try to say that I do blc I can't. I'm not going to say that I have been through what they have and understand how hard it is, blc I don't. Because they aren't treated the same though, I do my part and just show them my kindness respect, empathy and compassion for them. I can't relate, and I don't know how it feels, but I can prevent them from feeling that way again by having empathy, kindness, and respect for them regardless of their skintone. There are just these dumbass white people who think they are discriminated against too, which is bullshit. Just treat everyone well, that's all I mean. I'm not trying to say I'm different from them or that they are apart from me at all, they've just had to bare with things and certain problems that I haven't blc of their skintone, which sucks.

1. For tear gas, bring leamon and when you are feeling the effects, squeeze the lemon on your mouth and that will help a lot

"THIS IS GENIUS. So like the video has all of these messages lying around, important things we are supposed to focus on, but Gambino and his group would take the spot in front and do all these dances, and I find myself distracted with it and my attention would shift on that ENTIRELY while the people that kept running in the background, the sound of gun shots and other chaotic stuff would find itself in the back of my mind (and the frame) until I have to force myself to look away from the dancing. Just like irl. Where things that matter can easily be covered by a blindfold of false reality as a means of (again) distraction. The dancing and other superficial media trends. While real life happens in the background. It's difficult for me to articulate because I'm still so blown away by this realization. 

Basically this hits the audience in different levels. Others can see it immediately, while some have to watch it several times to acknowledge the messages (and I think something called ""being privileged""ù plays a role in that.) Everyone's focus can be easily on the front: the dance and all the shazz, or hardly at the back: the constant issues of racism to this generation, the unfairness of the system, the wrongness it all.",This is SPOT ON.

"Some of the recent comments here are so ignorant to the ongoing situation. Let me just start by saying that racial intolerance towards any group is bad, and I don't support racism or racist individuals. With that said, America is not the most racist country on the planet. Far from it, at that. I could make the argument that Japan is a more racist society than the United States, but that isn't the point. The United States provides people of all backgrounds the opportunity to live a comfortable life and work to provide for themselves and those around them. At the end of the day, it comes down to an individuals desire to do so. Black people in America are not as widely discriminated and attacked as you'd think. I am not claiming that it never happens, but it's not a regular occurrence and it is not promoted or endorsed by any level of government. The four police officers involved in the death of Mr. Floyd were all fired shortly after the incident. None were protected as some claim and they were all condemned by the police department at which they were employed. The key officer that was responsible for the man's death had a troubled record in the department and probably should have been fired long ago, I highly doubt his conduct was entirely racially motivated. It seems more likely he had a disregard for professionalism, having been involved in many police shootings, rather than the mindset of attacking and discriminating against black people. The response to the situation is disgusting and the people who support it need to re-evaluate their position.The police did not escalate anything. Police only responded after violence erupted with stores being looted and property being damaged, and they responded accordingly with non-lethal force to subdue those committing violence. However, it has simply grown into a situation of domestic terrorism and needs to end for the safety of everyone. Hopefully the national guard can end it so that those who wish to peacefully protest can resume doing so.
TL;DR - America isn't as racist or horrible as people would like you to believe. The key officer involved in the death of Floyd had a bad record in the force anyways and his conduct doesn't seem to be entirely motivated by race. Twin cities riots have devolved basically into domestic terrorism and need to end.","@Diapontios While it is regrettable there are black people who are killed by police officers that engage in gross negligence, the problem is blown out of proportion. Hundreds of people are killed every year by police brutality and gross negligence by police, this is not an issue exclusive to black Americans. You do not have to be from a country to research and understand the issues facing another country. If we go by your logic, then nobody outside of the United States should be able to comment on the happenings and political situation in the country. Side note - a majority of black men in the United States are killed by other black men, not police. I want everyone to live peacefully and have the ability to prosper and succeed in their country, however people need to address the real issues facing their society and not create scapegoats out of emotionally charged incidents.",4,1,Some

I stand with all of black people especially those in America, everyone who has ever experienced racism. I promise to fight with you, I promise to stand by you. I promise to help your voices be heard. The wrong treatment you receive on a daily basis and have done for centuries absolutely disgusts me and makes me feel so deeply uncomfortable, I can not even imagine how you must feel, how scared you must be. The situations you have been through breaks my heart as no one should have to go through such things. I am so grateful to always be learning about the struggles you face and I am so glad that you are making your voices heard and that I can continue to be educated about your history and everything you go through. I promise to use this information wisely and to help myself grow and teach others and learn more. Please continue to educate me so I can shine a light with you on the wrong things you are experiencing. I send you all so much light and positivity, always! I promise to support you and to always, always speak up with you and on your behalf, especially for those who's voices can no longer be heard, especially for those like George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, innocent people who have lost their lives because of their skin colour and at the hands of people who the general public of each country are supposed to trust and be protected by such as, America's racist, violent police officers. Not just in America but racism is a global issue therefore I shall speak up no matter the location. I apologise that I haven't spoken up on the matter so vocally before now, I apologise that this matter hasn't gained that much attention until now. I apologise that because of my selfish ancestors you and your family and friends have experienced awful things. I promise to never be like my ancestors and I promise to treat you with respect and to stand with you. As a generation we can afford to be so much more vocal and have such a stronger voice especially thanks to those in the past who have fought for justice, let's not let their hard work go to waste or be forgotten. I promise to use my voice to fight with you for what is right! I do wish I had a bigger voice and a bigger impact so that I can better spread more awareness on this matter. On all the wrong systematic, racist things black people experience on a daily basis specifically in America and specifically right now and have done for centuries. I promise to use the voice I do have, no matter how big or small to shine a light on the injustice that is happening. I promise to not sit still or stay silent. I'm not black, but I see you.

"My dad gave me this as a critical thinking challenge and said, ""Watch this video a couple times through, understand the meaning and subtext, then tell me why or why not this should be the most iconic music video of 2010-2019.
I've gotten this so far:
This music video is focusing on discrimination against black people by white people, that much is clear by the ending and the shooting of the black choir. If you watch this video for the first time, you pay attention to Childish Gambino and the dancing, occasionally looking at the chaotic background. However, the dancing is to distract you and prove a point. The song hints many times at the usage of guns. (The lyrics ""Guns in my area""ù and ""I got the strap *strap is a term for a gun*""ù and with the usage of guns proves this factor. ) If you pay attention to the lyrics, partying and money are mentioned a lot as well as Gucci, Houses, and other expensive valuables, which are things Americans enjoy having/doing. Now, for the more subtle lyric hints. The lyrics ""Police be trippin' now""ù might refer to police being more suspect towards black people. The lyric ""This is guerilla""ù refers to black people rioting against white people as the term guerilla is a small group of people fighting against a larger group.  In the song, Childish Gambino talks about hunnid bands, which is 100,000 dollars, while the words ""Contraband, Contraband, Contraband, Contraband""ù play after it. (A contraband is illegal imported goods/ drugs.) 
Another thing is the lyrics talk about social media and the follower count as ""You motherfuckas owe me""ù comes after, stating that he only cares about being verified and the money that will come after it.
Lastly, the last 3 lyrics 
""I kenneled him in the backyard
No probably ain't life to a dog
For a big dog""ù
I believe these words talk about how the life's of others don't affect those who are rich and only want power. The kenneled part speaks about putting someone in a cage, or their place (Most likely a person of color) while the part about lives to dogs is talking about how the lives of those caged individuals are just pawns to people with higher authority or value.
(Edit: Here are Imagery subtext/background images in the video)
- 2:14 is a suicide in the background. Everyone else is just partying and running around it like it's not there.
-0:52. The hood on the man's head is a form of torture as it blocks your sense of sight so you don't know when you die as well as it shows that the victim is unknown and to be forgotten.
-0:55 and 0:59. The gun is put on a pillow while the body is dragged away. This represents how people are so quick to assume a gun killed someone (putting it on a pedestal) while they don't care about the person who actually died.
-1:02 is a car behind Childish Gambino, representing how people party without worry, not realizing the destruction around them as the body is dragged off-screen. The people running behind Childish Gambino could also represent a riot or assault as they are waving some sort of object.
-1:16-- is where a lot happens. The most concerning thing for me is that in the top right-hand corner area  (Behind the car), you can see a figure strike something with a weapon. It's hard to see as you need to slow it down to fully capture it. Also, if you just pay attention to the background from --1:16- 1:31, you can see people running with weapons and looking like they are robbing/ attacking the cars in the area while others are just partying around them.
-1:38 is when someone is throwing money around with a device. (Idk what it is called and I'm to lazy to google it.) This represents how people are so focused on money in America.
-1:57. Again with the gun on the pillow as people run towards the bodies with weapons and batons (Most likely police.) while Childish Gambino passes an empty police car.
-2:35 is a burning car as someone wearing all black rides past us on a white horse. (Signalling death.)
-2:36 is hard to see, but you can see people possibly robbing and attacking someone (or just the car) in their car as people dance around them. (It's behind Childish Gambino)
-3:27 is a whole bunch of empty cars. This could possibly mean a couple things. It could mean all the drivers/passengers have been killed or taken away so no one can drive them, or they could be empty because they were just robbed. It could also mean a more figurative type view on the world as it could show that we've abandoned protesting for racism to be over and we are just accepting what we have only done before, hence why there is only Childish Gambino, one woman, and the faceless victim in the shot. This could show that they are the only ones still fighting racism.

My only concern, or perhaps question, is... What if this is a Strawman America fabricated from a place of hijacked realism fueled by pain created to divide and conquer by pointing fingers at an Umbrella term such as ""America""- a symbol of refuge for some (who wish to defend it as if it were their guardian) and a scar from an unforgiven history for others (who desire some form of escape by fight or flight as if from a predator).

Man this really hits different as a black woman with parents and grandparents who worked and marched with MLK. Even then she was called a thug and disruption to society as they blocked the roads to protest  I miss my grand mother 1st hand encounters and wanted to ask her so more. RIP to the best and strongest woman who was ever so graceful. That Charleston shooter reference reminded me of some of her words and Pearls of Wisdom.,"@Aisling Most don't and I know this personally.  For those that do you actually need to understand what actually happened.... it's out of fustration. When my parents were involved in the Civil Rights Movement we had to force America to make a really tough decision and look at themselves morally and we had to understand how deep the hate was for our people. Keep in mind Malcolm X and Martin Luther King were both leaders at the same time.  This was very much intentional. We had to see how the American population would react to a platform built off of self defense and economic empowerment versus one of being a victim purposefully and just being peaceful at all times. Little known fact, WIC, a program now used to feed babies and children was started by the black panthers.  I digress, both Malcolm X and and MLK were murdered. Martin  got the holiday. And before he died he very much said """"òI fear I am integrating my people into a burning house' . This specifically means I've led my people to their death. My grandmother was a very honest graceful woman and I will never dishonored either her or MLK. But I wonder if the Charleston shooter or the situation with Ahmaud now would even be an issue if the out come was different.  It's a tough call. As my parents ask it's a tough call, do you remain peaceful and allow yourself to be a victim and shot like a dog just to save the perception of your legacy or do you survive in a protect the legacy of your children at the stake of your perception as a human being?  Do you lay dow. die and be called a person of peace or do you fight for the right to life live and get labeled as a thug or monkey?

Europeans: **breakdancing**","lfrsnc technically the world wars are overall a benefit to humanity. Huge advancements in technology were made (flight and power along with machinery), growth was only slowed temporarily for most countries and peaceful trade was established along with democracy. It also lead to the end of colonial imperialism, as well as nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are a huge benefit until they are not. They are the largest deterrent that exists, as no country with nukes will ever fight another country with nukes, thus ensuring peace. The medical advancements were huge too.

War creates innovation and growth, which is one of the reasons America loves fighting wars on the far side of the world.
