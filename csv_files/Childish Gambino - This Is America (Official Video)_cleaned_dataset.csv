Do not be deceived by demon time anthems & antics. The torture & torment they inflict on themselves is a real terror they do not enjoy. Nevertheless these individuals have obviously/knowingly sold/enslaved their souls to satan/the prince of the air/the fallen one for temporary fame/fortune on earth with damnable intentions of spending eternity with the great dragon in the most flaming hot fire for eternity.....,0,0

This country definitely has a bad track record of shit training of police and hiring psychopaths / racists.  It’s a big enough problem that should be covered in the news more. Just like police murdering their girlfriends and wives and never being held accountable for it because their buddies are cops. Many police departments operate like gangs. They cover up each other’s crimes and have too many protections. Politicians and police should be held accountable for their actions like everyone else.  They should also not have military weapons  to attack their own people with. And they shouldn’t use shooting as a preferred method of “arrest”,1,2
