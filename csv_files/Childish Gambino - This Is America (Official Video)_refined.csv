"31 years ago , when i was 11 , my generation got our wake up call . 
janet jackson's rhythm nation 1814 . not just the single . . . . . the entire album . it shaped a generation , turned a generation , moved a generation . 

something went wrong . i am not sure when exactly . i was so sure the progression of the 25 years following the release was going so well . . . . . i just did not get it , until it hit me directly in the face . 

i am now 42 . i am going into the middle of my lifetime expectancy . as is all of the janet followers of the ideal that:
 "" in complete darkness we are all the same . it is only our knowledge and wisdom that separates us . don't let your eyes deceive you . "" 

it is shortly going to be no longer in our hands to try and bring about any kind of progress and change . that is for those younger than myself to begin taking up . this is your message . 
and though janet had to kind of dance around the topic , it was still there for us to hear and see within the videos . 
this . . . . . . . this is literally hitting it on the head . it is the right message . and it has to be heard . 
get off your asses
get off your phones
get out there and communicate with the people around you directly . 

in america we have just held the most insane and "" what the fuck "" election cycle in my lifetime . our president elect is joe biden . 
i am begging my democratic friends to not forget there was almost half that did vote republican , and or are still president trump supporters . don't leave them behind in your progression forward . americans are a breed of red and blue . . . . . black and white . all colors of all countries are here within the confines of ours . 
all faiths , all orientations living together more coherently than any other combination of 20 countries out there . 
moving forward requires everyone going forward . no one can be left behind while others move forward . it remains our biggest mistake through the centuries . this includes the trump supporter or the republican voters . and i know . . . . . . . they did not extend the same hand 4 years ago . i get it . 
but if you witnessed the disintegration of the last four years play out . . . . . you know that you cannot repeat the same mistake . pick the people up , dust them off , and bring them along . let them know as well that they are part of america too .",this was beautiful im ngl i got kinda confused toward the end but i agree our country is more divided than ever almost half the votes went to trump the other to biden we need to do something fast we shouldnt be scared for the future we shouldnt have to protest for people to be equal your a very smart person i agree with everything you said,2,17,31 years,31 years
"733m views and people still getting shot by cops , still getting robbed by our government . still the same .",thats why people protest just look at the dislikes these are people who disagree with his message and the message was equality,10,1,733m views,733m views

"0:22 shows a barefoot man , which represents the people on the streets that need money . 
0:50 the gun pops out of nowhere , which represents how easily people can get a gun , using it irresponsibly and brutally . it also represents the brutality we put on the homeless . 
0:54 giving the gun to the kid , which represents young people getting a hold up dangerous things . 
1:10 is society and memes , basically showing no affection . 
1:41 charleston massacre
2:00 the police cars are empty because it shows that police only focus on the minor things and don't want to investigate society itself . 
2:44 to 3:00 is the silence of kids ans teens hiding during a school lockdown/shooting . 
3:50 to 4:05 shows people getting chased to get killed or mugged . 




this is america , welcome to the mess and brutality .","i have a few things to add

0:54 i guess this could be about how easy it is for kids to get guns ( like you said ) but i disagree because it's such a formal exchange . this point could have been made just by having the kids all have guns . i think it's actually about how guns are treated so carefully and respectfully , contrasting with the horrible treatment against the people who are being killed

2:25 celly ( cell phone ) is a tool ( gun ) in the police's eyes , so it is an excuse to kill unarmed black men . you can also see kids in the background holding up their cell phones

2:34 an empty parked cop car , and a horse running past . maybe saying that police are less 'modern' and effective than horses or something along those lines

3:40 it's hard to hear but the singer is saying how people treat you like a piece of shit when you're black even if you have money , and that you're treated like a big dog ( pun on dawg ) and caged

i'd also like to add that i have no idea what you mean by the police not wanting to "" investigate society itself "" like how are they even supposed to do that ? i think the empty cars are more a reference to police not doing enough to help the struggle of black people in america in particular , seeing as this song is so much about the black experience in america . laws and law enforcement are not doing nearly enough to stop violence in and against black communities . they're technically there but they aren't doing anything . 

i also disagree that 2:44 to 3:00 is the silence of kids hiding during a lockdown or shooting . to me the silence means more that a lot of people are dead , maybe alluding to the fact that so many black people die in america and if you live in a black community you are more likely than anybody else to have lost somebody you care about . 

my final disagreement is that 3:50 to 4:05 shows "" people getting chased to be killed or mugged "" . the lyrics in this section are about how white people and cops treat black people like dogs , to be killed/kenneled . when/if the people chasing glover catch him they aren't going to mug him , they're going to kill him or lock him up because they're white police . in the rest of the video when he wasn't being chased but he was still living in a dangerous place , glover was dancing and everybody was singing in harmony even though there was a lot of violence . there is a clear contrast at the end where there is absolutely no sense of unity between glover and the people who are chasing him",1,3,0:22 shows,0:22 shows

"sharing is caring . dear friend , are you saved ? 
if you died tonight will you go to heaven or hell ? 
the bible says: god is holy and heaven is holy which means perfect . god can never let anybody or anything imperfect or sinful enter heaven . 
have you ever lied once ? stolen once ? hated once ? the answer is yes . this makes you a liar , a thief and a murderer according to god . so if you were to die this night you will go to hell because you have sinned and the punishment of sin is death . 
 the excellent news is that god wants you in heaven with him . but as a just god , he has to punish your sins . he has provided a way to save you . there is someone perfect who was willing to take your punishment , mine and the one of the whole world . 
 john 3:16 says: for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son , that whoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life . 
so christ died on the cross for our sins . 
 
 what can you do to be saved ? 
1-	admit you are a sinner . 
2-	be willing to turn to jesus as the only one who can save you ( repent ) . 
 3-believe that jesus died for you , was buried and rose from the dead , according to the scriptures . romans 10:9 says: that if you confess with your mouth the lord jesus and believe in your heart that god has raised him from the dead , you will be saved . 
 4-now through prayer , invite jesus into your life to become your personal saviour . 
 5- pray this prayer of salvation : ( say it aloud ) 
dear god , i come to you in the name of jesus . i admit i am a sinner . i thank you that you loved me so much to send your son to die in my place . i believe in my heart that jesus christ died on the cross and shed his blood for my sins , was buried and rose again . 
i ask you to forgive me , father . 
i now invite you lord jesus , to come into my heart and life as my personal lord and saviour . amen . 
now you are saved or born again what do you do after ? 
1-read your bible everyday to get to know christ better and all that he has in store for you ( healing , deliverance , prosperity etc . ) 
2-talk to god in prayer everyday . 
3-be baptized , worship , fellowship and serve with other christians in a good bibelbelieving church . 
4-tell others about jesus . 
nb: congratulations . you have just made the most important decision of your life by accepting jesus .

in terms of blake , the guy who had an open warrant for child abuse . . . . . it's pretty clear to me that after shooting blake with a taser , which renders useless , and after he told the officers he has a weapon , blake ignores all officers warnings , even as the officer is pulling on his shirt to not go towards his car . . . he proceeds to his car anyway , clearly reached toward the floor board , and then the officer shoots him multiple times in the back . 

criminal history; all you social justice warriors don't understand that yes , your criminal history and the information the officers have on this guy ahead of the call , the nature of the original 911 call etc , all work toward the "" totality of the circumstances "" , meaning it can lend towards the officers decision . those things that will be presented in court that cnn and msnbc don't tell you about , are very important . 
 
this is all about supporting a false narrative that police are out to kill you even though just about 99% of all police shootings were the result of some struggle/altercation with police just prior to the officer using his/her firearm . if you don't want to be shot by the police , quit fucking fighting them and obey the orders . if you think they're being unlawful with their authority or use of force ( the super rare chance that would happen ) , guess what , chances are they have several cameras and microphones recording the whole interaction . meanwhile , dozens and dozens of black people are getting murdered in the streets to black on black crime . where is the outrage ? where is the concern for human life ? why don't they talk about the disproportionate rate of black babies being aborted or born outside of wedlock ? i could go on and on . . . oh by the way the hennepin co me's summary on george floyd's toxicology report ? ? ? couldn't have been the lethal doses of fentanyl in his system , in which he was already complaining of lack of breath prior to being arrested , that led to his death . . . . nooooooo waaaaay !","brother this is all true

"the meanings and hidden messages behind this video:
the opening shows a man strumming a guitar alone to choral sounds . the camera soon goes onto donald , as you can see the pants he is wearing is assumed to be the old confederate army pants , within the first minute donald shoots the man , who has been tied up with a head cover . donald hands the gun to another man , who safely wraps it in a red cloth as the obscured man is dragged away ( donald could have picked any colour for the fabric of the cloth . he chose red because it's representative of republican-dominated states , which shows that america value guns over black lives ) . before donald shoots the man , while he is walking over to the man he dances with "" exaggerated movements and faecal expressions "" , while donald takes the gun out before he shoots he does a pose which represents "" jim krow "" this "" character "" was used in the late 1800's and early 1900's , when white actors preformed in blackface ( 0:51 ) . "" jim krow "" the fictional racist character that characterized african-americans as "" lazy , stupid , and inherently less human . "" the character was created and performed by thomas d . rice in the early 1800s at early minstrel shows . ( 1:07 ) as you can see kids soon join in on the dancing with donald , they were placed there to "" distract "" you from whats going on in background , ( which represents on how america puts the media first to distract you from whats going on in the "" background "" like gun violence , racist hate crimes , riots , kidnappings , and e . t . c ) . ( 1:40 ) in another shocking turn , donald mows down a church choir with an assault rifle . it's an image that seems to reference the killing of nine people at a predominantly african-american church by white supremacist dylann roof in charleston , south carolina , in 2015 . once again , the gun is whisked away with care on a red cloth . ( even after the roof massacre , the united states failed to pass a single law restricting gun ownership . ) ( 2:25 ) he raps "" this is a celly/that's a tool . "" ( as he raps those verses , the camera pans up to show multiple kids holding cell phones . the line could have multiple meanings . the next verse , "" on my kodak , "" referring to the film brand , could refer to how the proliferation of cellphones allows people to capture images of police violence . 
it could also be a reference to the march 18 police shooting of stephon clark , an unarmed black man holding a cell phone . 
or it could refer to prison cells the warehouse where the music video takes place somewhat resembles a prison which are used as tools of oppression . ) ( 2:34 ) "" death on a white horse gallops "" you can see a man covered with a black mask riding a white horse ( the image appears to be a reference to verse 6:8 in the book of revelation , the last book in the new testament . in the king james translation , it goes like this: "" and i looked , and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was death , and hell followed with him . and power was given to them over the fourth part of the earth , to kill with sword , and with hunger , and with death , and with the beasts of the earth . "" ) ( 2:45 - 3:00 ) the song comes to a halt , and glover strikes up a joint to smoke . there are 17 seconds of silence , as a moment of respect for the 17 victims of the parkland , florida highschool shooting , ( 3:30 ) many of the cars have the driver's door open . ( it's a metaphor representative of how african-americans are often forced to pull over and step outside of their vehicles by police officers . black drivers are asked to pull over at higher rates than white drivers , ) all of the cars are old , all the cars in the video are models from the '80s and '90s none of them are new or flashy . not everyone can afford the new , flashy cars in most rap music videos . it may also be a commentary on the american obsession with capitalist consumption . ( 3:41 ) the ending of the video draws comparisons to "" get out . "" the final scene of the video shows donald running from what seems to be white riot police officers . 
 ( some people understood it as him running from "" the sunken place "" from "" get out , "" a metaphysical place that holds the black consciousness while a white mind takes over a black person's body . it could be read as donald trying to escape simply being a body to be used by white people for distraction . ) threw out this video donald plays the role of "" america """,is this a copypasta ? just wondering,6,111,meanings hidden,the meanings

"cant believe americans can their current gun laws . when 1:55 in the video isnt an exaggeration , its what happens frequently in america , its literally a representation of one of the many shooting that happen their , i cant remember the name of the shooting just because of the sheer amount of shootings that happen there . if there was a shooting like that in the uk , france , australia , or anywhere else with strict gun laws , everyone would remember it because of how uncommon it is . there are more gun shops in america than mcdonalds , starbucks and supermarkets combined , things need to change . 

edit: i just googled it and 1:55 is a representation of the charleston church shooting , where a white man went into the charleston church to kill mass amounts of black people , if there was gun control , he would be restricted to a knife or bat , this would of resulted in maximum 1 death as once one person has been stabbed , everyone can flee for safety and a single stab wound usually isnt fatal . wake the fuck up , scotland had a school shooting called the dunblane massacre in 1996 , as a result of it , gun laws were introduced , there hasnt been a shooting in scotland since . the uk have about 36 gun deaths average a year , the us have on average about 85 a day , compare this with the fact that the uk have about 6 guns per 100 people whereas the us have about 89 guns per 100 . wake up america",u can type alot,3,2,cant believe,cant believe

"its the wealthy people spreading propaganda that perpetuates the racism in america . the purpose is division . if one ethnicity hates another , they would never work with them . in the case of america , its white people hating black people . . or really anyone non-white . these division are seeded by putting the blame of society's problems on an ethnic minority . this way , combined with hate , one half of the population will be hating and blaming minorities for society's problems , while the minorities will be left living in fear of their lives . 

with the population blaming innocent people in fear of their lives , the wealthy white men who start these division are free to do as they please because anything that they do wrong will just be blamed on minorities . 

white supremacy is also perpetuated as a form of propaganda designed to make the white male look superior to all other identities . this is for the purpose of justifying the wealthy white man's greed . if white men are seen as superior , then it gives a justification for their atrocities , even though it is completely false . 

the way to combat this is to first realize this is true . you don't have to take my word for it . read "" a peoples history of the united states "" written by the famous historian howard zinn . 

we then have to realize , as white men ( i am a white male ) , that we have been complacent in the suffering of these victims of the wealthy white mans propaganda . we have to stop accepting this as ok , or just a fact of life . we have to realize that these people are our brothers and sisters , and we cannot let them live in fear any longer .",babby piss pant shit burger,2,1,wealthy people,its the

"my interpretation childish is showing and representing that black entertainers , politicians anyone who made it out the system , are the new jim crow , saying in the begin we just want the money hes being egotistical saying we want to . . . but really meaning him as in i ( black entertainers , politicians ) when he shoots and kills the black man he looks back at him like hes better then him , which most black entertainers think after selling themselves out to make money . ps ( candice owen ) his dances are what the original jim crow was used to distracted the white masses . it also symbolizes what most white people over the age of 30 think about black culture as stupid dumb like rap song , clothes , dances . when you see the young black kids come in the frame copying glover ( aka ) new jim crow dances after and while the violence in the background proceeds , childish dancing is the distraction to reality . since most black kids in america dont understand or lack the ability to understand whats happening in the america but the newest dance , they can get do and know without hesitation . also dancing reflects all america as the chaos in the background proceeds without getting anyones attention only until he shoot then everyone stops , getting everyone attention like the charleston church shooting , school shootings , and many others . its crazy how this music video is so relevant since you see it in real time , since covid 19 with limit entertainment , unemployment , and literally the stoppage of the world , has people dealing with everyday reality and events of racism , how we treat each other . if covid 19 wasnt a thing guarantee you george floyd , breanna taylor , ahmed arbery , wouldve last about week before it faded off for by unimportant things in society . people on the so called system would still be looked at like scum , but now that a lot of people need unemployment , because of a situation that they themselves couldnt change , gives people a reality to a lot of poor people exact situation . then as the music goes on glover say dont let them catch you slipping now , i interpreted as him trying to keep up with the image of not falling off as a celebrity , then in the end as he takes a break rolls a joint he realizes hes part of the problem so he escapes , running through the tunnel could represent underground railroad , a slave running from his plantation , with the slave hunters trying to catch him",wow ! ! makes so much sense !,5,43,interpretation childish,my interpretation

[how] art thou cut down to the ground , which didst weaken the nations ! 13 for thou hast said in thine heart , i will ascend into heaven , i will exalt my throne above the stars of god: i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation , in the sides of the north: 14 i will ascend above the heights of the clouds; i will be like the most high . 15 yet thou shalt be brought down to hell , to the sides of the pit . 16 they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee , [and] consider thee , [saying , is] this the man that made the earth to tremble , that did shake kingdoms; 17 [that] made the world as a wilderness , and destroyed the cities thereof; [that] opened not the house of his prisoners ?

this one who thought all us , humans , was all still worth dying for even after the fall and not satan lamb with 2 horns coming to try take the whole world to hell with them before they reap what they have sown ! 

but the lamb of god who already made that way , and even way of escape , from that hour that is coming to try the whole world ! 

when god is going to use your own god against yous ! 

 unless you repent

i noticed no one said anything really about the dancing but its supposed to distract you from the background and whats happening ( like how music distracts you from the real world ) the facial expressions are to make sure he gets your attention but there were some parts of how he rolled his body that imitates what people thought african americans act like . ( not saying they do ) and in some parts you could see the man that was riding on a horse ( 2:36 ) was in multiple scenes way in the back doing something to people . ( its very hard to pause and catch them since its quick which represents how fast we forget what we did to human beings ) . these are some things we discussed and there was a lot more ( like the seventeen seconds of silence to represent the 17 deaths in the schools shooting ),ice cube ye theres a lot of messages in this song shooting . kids in masks and police . and cars on fire,1,3,noticed one,i noticed

"statistics from the wall street journal from the article named 'the myth of systemic police racism' - "" the police fatally shot nine unarmed blacks and 19 unarmed whites in 2019 , according to a washington post database , down from 38 and 32 , respectively , in 2015 . . . . by contrast , a police officer is 18 times more likely to be killed by a black male than an unarmed black male is to be killed by a police officer . ""","firstly , compare those numbers to demographics . 9:19 is a terrible record . it means 1 unarmed black person killed by police for every 2 . 1 white people . if it were in line with demographics it would be 1 black person to every 4 . 5 white people . comparison to a year that was much worse doesn't make it ok . the stat shows police in 2019 killing unarmed black males at more than double the rate of unarmed white males proportionally . 
secondly , of course a police officer is much more likely to be killed by a male ( of any color ) than an unarmed male ( of that color ) is to be killed by a police officer . police spend a hugely disproportionate amount of time in dangerous situations compared to unarmed civilian males . that should be obvious to anyone with a brain . without the comparable data for white civilians the stat quoted means nothing , and isolating it like that is fraudulent propaganda that will only convince idiots or the irrationally biased . 
thirdly , those two sets of stats don't combine in any meaningful way . "" by contrast "" makes no sense . 
fourthly , i note that you call these "" statistics from the wsj "" to give them weight , without mentioning that they come from an opinion piece by heather mac donald . you can look up her record on quoting accurate statistics to congress . . .

peacefully . 

how beautiful is that ? 

all lives cannot matter until you include black lives . 

you cannot say 'all lives matter' when you do nothing to stop systemic racism & police brutality . 

you cannot say 'all lives matter' when black people are dying and all you complain about is the looting . 

you cannot say 'all lives matter' when you allow children to be caged , veterans to go homeless , and poor families to go hungry & lose their health insurance . 

do all lives matter ? yes . but right now , only black lives are being targeted , jailed , and killed en masse- so that's who we're focusing on .

the message glover wants to express is that african americans are being exploited by the entertainment industry . to them , being successful in this industry allows them to escape poverty . thats why glover is rapping dont catch you slipping now , hes telling you to focus on his dancing and ignore whats happening in the background . he represents a person which has managed to escape the chaos of life as a black man , and now serves as a tool for the entertainment industry to distract you from the issues we face in america . in a way , his shooting of the black guitarist in the beginning is a metaphor for how he is hurting the black community . 

at the end of the video , the camera descends below the main floor , showing you the underlying cause behind everything youve just seen: no matter how successful he is , glover is still a victim of racism who cannot escape the confines of americas disdain for him .","everybody is a "" victim of racism "" , as there is racist people for every single "" race "" . there are black people who hate white people as there are white people who hate black people . what's the point in pointing out such an obvious fact ? it's simple: they simply try to create a victimhood ideology where conveniently one entire "" race "" is considered a victim . it's the exploitation of conflict , which has been a successful strategy since humans are humans because of people like you . your indoctrination is so extreme that you think about a millionare as "" a victim "" just because the color of his skin .",22,147,song titled,this song

"my comment will focus on donald glover and the camera , so many hidden cameras and references in the video:
donald glover = jim crow
camera = media controlled/filtered by jim crow
another video where you have to notice the video has round corners ( it's a camera; represents media showing only what's focused upfront and in 'the box' that america wants you to see . filters you from the truth of injustice , violence and corruption . 
we also see direct skits where the camera pans off of donald glover for a few seconds , but immediately returns back on him because the media won't admit the * full truth * just an acknowledgment on * some events , * if that . 
donald glover impersonating jim crow puppet/mascot to filter and distract audience from the actual problem . 
look at how cartoonish he acts by his ragdoll/cartoon posture , and face expressions on 0:40 , 0:51 , 0:59-1:08 , 1:16 , 1:24-1:29 , 1:48-1:52 , 2:11 , 2:25 , 

he's emulating what the current jim crow laws are doing and is winking or bulging his eyes to show you're not supposed to be looking at entertainment over what's actually happening . the lyrics follow with his words , and notice how goofy he acts like he's their friend before he shoots his victims down . sounds familiar of how america treats people of color ? 
 "" land of opportunity "" "" american dream "" 
as the video progresses , "" jim crow puppet "" ( donald glover ) acts less silly , and becomes blatantly serious like when he gestured the 17 seconds for parkland shooting; no wild expressions . similar to our situation with floyd , taylor , bland , edwards , etc . this is similar to police brutality when we raise attention and police decides to become less sensitive for protestors and civilians . dispatches of gunning protestors , vehicles running into crowds , baton beatings , etc . are all symbolized with donald glover being less sensitive and more serious and straightforward , not hiding guns or blending in . just straight up gesturing the trigger like in 2:44 , but in the beginning , glover had others taking his weapons 0:55 or him acting friendly 1:48-1:55 . now , he's pulling it , holding the trigger , and smoking a cigarette like he's tired of repeating this . 

as it ends , "" jim crow "" is running because people finally spotted the problem with our social issues , and the mass amount of people are tired of injustice and violence ( like us today: june 5th , 2020 )",first like / first comment . try me,2,1,comment focus,my comment

we know that george should be here , that cops shouldn't be falling into these repeated patterns , and that there should be a solution in the works + proper communication to show that the problem is being worked on . 

when we start to see protesters & police getting violent respectively , people breaking into stores and stealing , people beating each other up that are protesting together , people running over each other because they are scared or don't agree or whatever - it all has lost its overall meaning . at this point , nobody has a valid point to prove it seems . nobody is left with any dignity and it's like these "" sides "" fulfilled what the other side thought about them . even the peaceful protests who are trying to make a point are overshadowed by the riots going on , and that's too bad .

"gambino literally predicted what would happen if america doesnt make changes by addressing police brutality and racism issues . . . and we are here now . . . this is america . 
edit: read my explanation of what gambino "" predicted "" through the music video in my comment for more context . 
tldr: it's directly related to the imagery of our current protests in his mv ( violence , riots , etc ) , foreshadowing to what was going to happen at that breaking point where if issues aren't fixed , there will be a big resistance through non-stop protests for anti-racism and anti-police brutality cause just like it is happening today .",he didn't predict anything . gambino was down to earth .,14,697,gambino literally,gambino literally
"yeah yeah , we realize that you all grieve over the death of that black guy . interesting , how you would protest if the policeman were black and the floyd was white . . . a country of damn hypocrites who were stuck in the past with some kind of schizoid thoughts about racism , which has been gone for 70 years now . black lives matters . . . . how about - all lives meters ? think about it , when you will rob shops and engage in unpunished looting , you do all this for floyd , right huh ? i'm not even mentioning the virus situation . . . big groups of people staked on the street . . . well you are all nominated for darwin awards . congrats .",racism isn't gone you fucking dunce .,1,2,yeah yeah,yeah yeah

this song symbolizes many things about america like the fact that guns are handled more carefully than people or the fact we care so much about luxury and not enough about justice,"the video is just about meaning . it's expressing the different ways there is racism against blacks in this nation . from shooting the gun to the back of the black musician's head , in which he subsequently places the gun into a rich red cloth , but the body is dragged away , to shooting the choir and the riots starting , children , taking videos in masks to hide identity , then him dancing with the kids where he pulls out an imaginary gun and the children run away to show that people fear the blacks , signifying how the police then kill the blacks unjustly . there's you people , the whites , and then our people , the colored . rioting like this may be consequential to businesses and everything , but how selfish are we to have so much self interest , in times like ww1 , ww2 , the american revolution , civil war where people sacrificed their lives for better ideals , to fight for something they believe in . innocent people , pulling out guns to fight in a war against the evil racists or oppression .",1,1,song symbolizes,this song
