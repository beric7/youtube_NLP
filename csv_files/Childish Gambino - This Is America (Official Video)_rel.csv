Another case (happened if I wasn't wrong the day before yesterday, I'm not sure) of a delivery man named Matheus, was shot in the head because, according to the ""police"", he looked like a drug dealer! As if it wasn't bad, another delivery man (I can't say his name) was also killed in a stop order by ""policemen"" in a slum! (Both cases also in Rio de Janeiro) These two were not black, but their lives are also important! Just look at the ""reason"" for the deaths! Coincidence?

"31 years ago, when I was 11, my generation got our wake up call. 
Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814. Not just the single.....the entire album. It shaped a generation, turned a generation, moved a generation. 

Something went wrong. I am not sure when exactly. I was so sure the progression of the 25 years following the release was going so well.....I just did not get it, until it hit me directly in the face. 

I am now 42. I am going into the middle of my lifetime expectancy. As is all of the Janet followers of the ideal that:
""In complete darkness we are all the same. It is only our knowledge and wisdom that separates us. Don't let your eyes deceive you.""

It is shortly going to be no longer in our hands to try and bring about any kind of progress and change. That is for those younger than myself to begin taking up. This is your message. 
And though Janet had to kind of dance around the topic, it was still there for us to hear and see within the videos. 
This.......this is literally hitting it on the head. It is the right message. And it has to be heard. 
Get off your asses
Get off your phones
Get out there and communicate with the people around you directly. 

In America we have just held the most insane and ""what the fuck"" election cycle in my lifetime. Our President Elect is Joe Biden. 
I am begging my Democratic friends to not forget there was almost half that did vote Republican, and or are still President Trump supporters. Don't leave them behind in your progression forward. Americans are a breed of red and blue.....black and white. All colors of all countries are here within the confines of ours. 
All faiths, all orientations living together more coherently than any other combination of 20 countries out there. 
Moving forward requires everyone going forward. No one can be left behind while others move forward. It remains our biggest mistake through the centuries. This includes the Trump supporter or the Republican voters. And I know.......they did not extend the same hand 4 years ago. I get it. 
But if you witnessed the disintegration of the last four years play out.....you know that you cannot repeat the same mistake. Pick the people up, dust them off, and bring them along. Let them know as well that they are part of America too.",This was beautiful I’m ngl I got kinda confused toward the end but I agree our country is more divided than ever almost half the votes went to trump the other to Biden we need to do something fast we shouldn’t be scared for the future we shouldn’t have to protest for people to be equal your a very smart person I agree with everything you said,2,17

"Hi, I'm sorry for the English mistakes, I'm from Brazil and I'm writing this text through Google translator.
 I'm not sure if in the United States I'm white, maybe I'm Latin for you, I don't know, but here I'm white. A few years ago, I thought that all this racism was something that people exaggerated a little ... nowadays I realize that I was TOTALLY wrong, here in Brazil, with our current president, things are getting stranger and stranger , Brazil is with less and less hope, I have friends who have already told me that they are used to suffering racism, because it is something frequent, it really hurts, it leaves any human being with the minimum of intelligence, extremely bad.
 Anyway ... I'm ashamed to be part of a world where things like what happened to George Floyd happen so often ... But what I really want to say is that, even though I'm not the right person to talk about racism, after all I never suffered anything like that, I wanted to tell you that you have this problem in your life, that you stay strong, it's easy to talk but, keep your head up, one day things will be the right way, it's a matter of time and struggle .
 Again, sorry for the mistakes in English, and I hope I got the message I wanted.","i get you man, us light skinned latinos, even though we're not really white, very often benefit from white supremacy and racism even without realizing. racism is a problem EVERYWHERE. us more privileged people need to make sure oppressed voices are heard . black lives matter

"There is alot of symbolism in this video. for example: He shot the guy like that because he was imitating jim crow, a cartoon black imagery promoting racism.
His pants are that of the confederate army uniform.

Dance distracted from the riots and violence, we look to media to be entertained and dont focus on tragedy.
70-80s model cars abandoned, symbolizes how we've stopped progressing, ""racism is over"" and there has been no growth since, when  there is still much to be rectified.  

Smoked a joint as if to cope with the reality, and then dismisses it as if it never happened. 
Bag covered head shows that there are nameless faceless victims of violence, meant to be forgotten. 
Students recording from above with their cellphones instead of taking action, it also shows how when we see something happen we film it, and we don't intervene (Usually). The part where the choir singers were singing and he shot them all down was reffering to the charleston shooting, a crisis that happened in 2015.
 
There was also a white horse going by in the backround, In some cultures, white horses stand for the balance of wisdom and power. In others, like Christianity, the white horse is a symbol of death. The horse is a universal symbol of freedom without restraint, because riding a horse made people feel they could free themselves from their own bindings.
  
Also, I would have said that the use of the smiling and happy dancers was either more about (or in conjunction with the other messages) how we are happy to celebrate black culture -- their dance crazes, funny memes and entertainment -- except the moment it comes down to recognizing other parts of black culture, like rampant gun violence, racism and terror. ...then we don't care about it anymore. Black culture and black lives only matter when they're entertaining you, not when they're dying. Hope this helped everybody!",Government doesnt protect the 2nd A though...they are actively trying to take our guns away...restricting weapons doesnt make it any harder for criminals to get ahold of them,149,2695

0:21 A man barefoot with an old guitar, representing the poor class black man
0:41 The Jim Crow faces, also he is dressed with gold chains and fancy pants but shirtless, maybe representing the middle class or America itself?
0:50 The gun pops out of knowhere, how easy you can get guns, he is with his head covered becouse it can be anyone and you don't know who
0:55 Gives the gun to the kid (school shootings)
1:10 The viral dances and memes, how our society doesn't cares of all the chaos around us
1:56 Charleston Massacre
2:00 All the police cars in the video are empty, representing how police does nothing to stop the chaos happening in the country
2:28 The people that instead of helping just record everything in their phones to get some views
2:37 The white horse representing the Apocalypse
3:24 After all the chaos, this place is empty, representing how calm or messy can be the U.S, also the music tells this by mixing the trap and gospel 
3:54 The place looks very dark here on purpose, repressenting how black people are still in the shadows like an ethnic group",Damn,67,1517

Then we wonder why the world hates us. And this song is not helping. Yes we get the messages here but to a foreign country this song totally looks like we are proud of our violent culture in hiphop.

"My take on this song is this:

America is FUCKED up, and no one really pays attention to this fact—whether it be via trends, cells, or other avoidance means. 

This can be shown by simply looking away from the dancers. As soon as you do, a full-scale public outlash will become apparent. People shouting, pushing, and destroying property. Police are present as well, as are people who seem to be enjoying the chaos. Our minds is completely aware of the violence occurring in the background, but we instead opt to push them out, and focus on Gambino and his dancers. 

In the end of the video, the scene with the cars is quite unnerving. My take on the reason it's so unnerving is because there we're people there just a second ago—and now the place is completely empty. 

You'll notice that Gambino looks to be having fun in the beginning of the video, and with the church choir as well, but as soon as he gets bored, the people die. This, to me, looks to be a representation of just how easy it is to be entertained in the modern era. With cell phones, computers, and the internet at our disposal, boredom is practically nonexistent.",Lemon Bery TLDR :face_with_tears_of_joy:,2,38

“This a celly-“ is what the person pulling it out would be thinking, “-that’s a tool” is what the cop would be thinking before they shoot.",29,1215

Felt the same way. We’re so distracted and overwhelmed as a county.

The dancing is meant to  distract society from what goes on in the background,Seems its a cut against black people who shoot each other with a veneer of oblivious partying overlaying it.  Not very flattering to the millions of black people who work hard and raise families.,39,1524
"As an Asian girl, when this song first came out, despise the fact that the everyone went crazy, I perceived this as a meme. I saw images of this music video everywhere on the Internet, of ppl making memes out of it. I laughed and went a long w the thinking that it was just an exaggeration or a funny presentation of gun violence. Now that I’m watching it again, I realize the message behind it. I never understood what racial inequality meant for black ppl, what police brutality was, what being a gun violence victim was. Now that I’ve grown out of my immature self from two years ago, I’ve fully perceived this message. And as an asian ally, I will keep bringing awareness until America is fixed. Now that I know.",lovely comment :two_hearts:,11,413
